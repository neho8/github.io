                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The raster data model is widely used in applications ranging far beyond geographic information systems (GISs). Most likely, you are already very familiar with this data model if you have any experience with digital photographs. The ubiquitous JPEG, BMP, and TIFF file formats (among others) are based on the raster data model (see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../GIS/geospatial-data-management.html">Chapter 5 "Geospatial Data Management"</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../GIS/file-formats.html">Section 5.3 "File Formats"</a>). Take a moment to view your favorite digital image. If you zoom deeply into the image, you will notice that it is composed of an array of tiny square pixels (or picture elements). Each of these uniquely colored pixels, when viewed as a whole, combines to form a coherent image (Figure 4.1 "Digital Picture with Zoomed Inset Showing Pixilation of Raster Image").</span></p>

              &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Furthermore, all liquid crystal display (LCD) computer monitors are based on raster technology as they are composed of a set number of rows and columns of pixels. Notably, the foundation of this technology predates computers and digital cameras by nearly a century. The neoimpressionist artist, Georges Seurat, developed a painting technique referred to as “pointillism” in the 1880s, which similarly relies on the amassing of small, monochromatic “dots” of ink that combine to form a larger image (Figure 4.2 "Pointillist Artwork"). If you are as generous as the author, you may indeed think of your raster dataset creations as sublime works of art.</span></p>

				&nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The raster data model consists of rows and columns of equally sized pixels interconnected to form a planar surface. These pixels are used as building blocks for creating points, lines, areas, networks, and surfaces (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="../GIS/maps-and-map-types.html">Chapter 2 "Map Anatomy", Figure 2.6 "Map Overlay Process"</a> illustrates how a land parcel can be converted to a raster representation). Although pixels may be triangles, hexagons, or even octagons, square pixels represent the simplest geometric form with which to work. Accordingly, the vast majority of available raster GIS data are built on the square pixel (Figure 4.3 "Common Raster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and USGS DEM (right)"). These squares are typically reformed into rectangles of various dimensions if the data model is transformed from one projection to another (e.g., from State Plane coordinates to UTM [Universal Transverse Mercator] coordinates).</span></p>

                  <p class="title">Figure 4.3</span> - Common Raster Graphics Used in GIS Applications: Aerial Photograph (left) and USGS DEM (right)</p>

                </div>
				&nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Because of the reliance on a uniform series of square pixels, the raster data model is referred to as a grid-based system. Typically, a single data value will be assigned to each grid locale. Each cell in a raster carries a single value, which represents the characteristic of the spatial phenomenon at a location denoted by its row and column. The data type for that cell value can be either integer or floating-point (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="../GIS/geospatial-data-management.html">Chapter 5 "Geospatial Data Management"</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../GIS/geographic-data-acquisition.html">Section 5.1 "Geographic Data Acquisition"</a>). Alternatively, the raster graphic can reference a database management system wherein open-ended attribute tables can be used to associate multiple data values to each pixel. The advance of computer technology has made this second methodology increasingly feasible as large datasets are no longer constrained by computer storage issues as they were previously.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem:">The raster model will average all values within a given pixel to yield a single value. Therefore, the more area covered per pixel, the less accurate the associated data values. The area covered by each pixel determines the <a class="glossterm">spatial resolution</a> of the raster model from which it is derived. Specifically, resolution is determined by measuring one side of the square pixel. A raster model with pixels representing 10 m by 10 m (or 100 square meters) in the real world would be said to have a spatial resolution of 10 m; a raster model with pixels measuring 1 km by 1 km (1 square kilometer) in the real world would be said to have a spatial resolution of 1 km; and so forth.<span></p>
                &nbsp;
				<p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Care must be taken when determining the resolution of a raster because using an overly coarse pixel resolution will cause a loss of information, whereas using overly fine pixel resolution will result in significant increases in file size and computer processing requirements during display and/or analysis. An effective pixel resolution will take both the map scale and the minimum mapping unit of the other GIS data into consideration. In the case of raster graphics with coarse spatial resolution, the data values associated with specific locations are not necessarily explicit in the raster data model. For example, if the location of telephone poles were mapped on a coarse raster graphic, it would be clear that the entire cell would not be filled by the pole. Rather, the pole would be assumed to be located somewhere within that cell (typically at the center).</span></p>
              &nbsp;
				<p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Imagery employing the raster data model must exhibit several properties. First, each pixel must hold at least one value, even if that data value is zero. Furthermore, if no data are present for a given pixel, a data value placeholder must be assigned to this grid cell. Often, an arbitrary, readily identifiable value (e.g., −9999) will be assigned to pixels for which there is no data value. Second, a cell can hold any alphanumeric index that represents an attribute. In the case of quantitative datasets, attribute assignation is fairly straightforward. For example, if a raster image denotes elevation, the data values for each pixel would be some indication of elevation, usually in feet or meters. In the case of qualitative datasets, data values are indices that necessarily refer to some predetermined translational rule. In the case of a land-use/land-cover raster graphic, the following rule may be applied: 1 = grassland, 2 = agricultural, 3 = disturbed, and so forth (Figure 4.4 "Land-Use/Land-Cover Raster Image"). The third property of the raster data model is that points and lines “move” to the center of the cell. As one might expect, if a 1 km resolution raster image contains a river or stream, the location of the actual waterway within the “river” pixel will be unclear. Therefore, there is a general assumption that all zero-dimensional (point) and one-dimensional (line) features will be located toward the center of the cell. As a corollary, the minimum width for any line feature must necessarily be one cell regardless of the actual width of the feature. If it is not, the feature will not be represented in the image and will therefore be assumed to be absent.</span></p>

                &nbsp;
			      <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Several methods exist for encoding raster data from scratch. Three of these models are as follows:</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                  <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;"><b>1.</b><a class="glossterm">Cell-by-cell raster encoding.</a> This minimally intensive method encodes a raster by creating records for each cell value by row and column (Figure 4.5 "Cell-by-Cell Encoding of Raster Data"). This method could be thought of as a large spreadsheet wherein each cell of the spreadsheet represents a pixel in the raster image. This method is also referred to as “exhaustive enumeration.”</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;"><b>2.</b><a class="glossterm">Run-length raster encoding.</a> This method encodes cell values in runs of similarly valued pixels and can result in a highly compressed image file (Figure 4.6 "Run-Length Encoding of Raster Data"). The run-length encoding method is useful in situations where large groups of neighboring pixels have similar values (e.g., discrete datasets such as land use/land cover or habitat suitability) and is less useful where neighboring pixel values vary widely (e.g., continuous datasets such as elevation or sea-surface temperatures).</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;"><b>3.</b><a class="glossterm">Quad-tree raster encoding.</a> This method divides a raster into a hierarchy of quadrants that are subdivided based on similarly valued pixels (Figure 4.7 "Quad-Tree Encoding of Raster Data"). The division of the raster stops when a quadrant is made entirely from cells of the same value. A quadrant that cannot be subdivided is called a “leaf node.”</span></p>

			<h3>Advantages/Disadvantages of the Raster Model</h3>
            &nbsp;
              <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The use of a raster data model confers many advantages. First, the technology required to create raster graphics is inexpensive and ubiquitous. Nearly everyone currently owns some sort of raster image generator, namely a digital camera, and few cellular phones are sold today that don’t include such functionality. Similarly, a plethora of satellites are constantly beaming up-to-the-minute raster graphics to scientific facilities across the globe (Chapter 5 "Geospatial Data Management", Section 5.3 "File Formats"). These graphics are often posted online for private and/or public use, occasionally at no cost to the user.</span></p>
              &nbsp;
              <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Additional advantages of raster graphics are the relative simplicity of the underlying data structure. Each grid location represented in the raster image correlates to a single value (or series of values if attributes tables are included). This simple data structure may also help explain why it is relatively easy to perform overlay analyses on raster data (for more on overlay analyses, see Chapter 7 "Geospatial Analysis I: Vector Operations", Section 7.1 "Single Layer Analysis"). This simplicity also lends itself to easy interpretation and maintenance of the graphics, relative to its vector counterpart.</span></p>
              &nbsp;
              <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Despite the advantages, there are also several disadvantages to using the raster data model. The first disadvantage is that raster files are typically very large. Particularly in the case of raster images built from the cell-by-cell encoding methodology, the sheer number of values stored for a given dataset result in potentially enormous files. Any raster file that covers a large area and has somewhat finely resolved pixels will quickly reach hundreds of megabytes in size or more. These large files are only getting larger as the quantity and quality of raster datasets continues to keep pace with quantity and quality of computer resources and raster data collectors (e.g., digital cameras, satellites).</span></p>
              &nbsp;
              <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Notwithstanding the purpose of the map or GIS project at hand, it is critical that definitions of features are clear and remain consistent. Similarly, it is important that the attributes of features are also consistently defined, measured, and reported in order to generate accurate and effective maps in an efficient manner. Defining features and attributes of interest is often an iterative process of trial and error. Being able to associate a feature with a particular geometric form and to determine the feature type are central to map abstraction, facilitate mapping, and the application of GISs.</span></p>
              &nbsp;
              <h3>Map Content and Generalization</h3>
              &nbsp;
              <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The shape and content of maps vary according to purpose, need, and resources, among other factors. What is common to most maps, and in particular to those within a GIS, is that they are graphical representations of reality. Put another way, various graphical symbols are used to represent geographical features or entities. Annotation or text is also commonly used on maps and facilitates map interpretation. Learning about map content and map generalization is important because they serve as the building blocks for spatial data that are used within a GIS.</span></p>
              &nbsp;
              <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Building upon the previous discussion about the geometric form of geographic features, maps typically rely on three geometric objects: the point, the line, and the polygon or area. A point is defined by x and y coordinates, a line is defined by two points, and a polygon is defined by a minimum of three points. The important thing to note is that the definition of a point is analogous to a location that is defined by longitude and latitude. Furthermore, since lines and polygons are made up of points, location information (i.e., x and y, or longitude and latitude, coordinates) is intrinsic to points, lines, and polygons.</span></p>
              &nbsp;
              <div class="figure large medium-height editable block">

              </div>
               &nbsp;   
               <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Both simple and complex maps can be made using these three relatively simple geometric objects. Additionally, by changing the graphical characteristics of each object, an infinite number of mapping possibilities emerge. Such changes can be made to the respective size, shape, color, and patterns of points, lines, and polygons. For instance, different sized points can be used to reflect variations in population size, line color or line size (i.e., thickness) can be used to denote volume or the amount of interaction between locations, and different colors and shapes can be used to reflect different values of interest.</span></p>

               <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Complementing the graphical elements described previously is annotation or text. Annotation is used to identify particular geographic features, such as cities, states, bodies of water, or other points of interest. Like the graphical elements, text can be varied according to size, orientation, or color. There are also numerous text fonts and styles that are incorporated into maps. For example, bodies of water are often labeled in italics.</span></p>
               &nbsp;
               <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Another map element that deserves to be mentioned and that combines both graphics and text is the map legend or map key. A <a class="glossterm">map legend</a> provides users information about the how geographic information is represented graphically. Legends usually consist of a title that describes the map, as well as the various symbols, colors, and patterns that are used on the map. Such information is often vital to the proper interpretation of a map.</span></p>
               &nbsp;
               <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">As more features and graphical elements are put on a given map, the need to generalize such features arises. <a class="glossterm">Map generalization</a> refers to the process of resolving conflicts associated with too much detail, too many features, or too much information to map. In particular, generalization can take several forms.</span></p>
               &nbsp;
               <ul>
                <li><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The simplification or <a class="glossterm">symbolization</a> of features for emphasis</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The masking or displacement of detail to increase clarity or legibility</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The selection of detail for inclusion or omission from the map</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The exaggeration of features for emphasis</span></li>
              </ul>               
              &nbsp;
              <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Determining which aspects of generalization to use is largely a matter of personal preference, experience, map purpose, and trial and error. Though there are general guidelines about map generalization, there are no universal standards or requirements with regard to the generalization of maps and mapping. It is at this point that cartographic and artistic license, prejudices and biases, and creativity and design sense—or lack thereof—emerge to shape the map.</span></p>
              &nbsp;
              <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Making a map and, more generally, the process of mapping involve a range of decisions and choices. From the selection of the appropriate map scale and map projection to deciding which features to map and to omit, mapping is a complex blend of art and science. In fact, many historical maps are indeed viewed like works of art, and rightly so. Learning about the scale, shape, and content of maps serves to increase our understanding of maps, as well as deepen our appreciation of maps and map making. Ultimately, this increased geographical awareness and appreciation of maps promotes the sound and effective use and application of a GIS.</span></p>
