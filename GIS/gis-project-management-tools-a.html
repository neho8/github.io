                      <li>The objective of this section is to review a sampling of the common tools and techniques available to complete GIS project management tasks.</li>
                  </ol>
              </div>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">As a project manager, you will find that there are many tools and techniques that will assist your efforts. While some of these are packaged in a geographic information system (GIS), many are not. Others are mere concepts that managers must be mindful of when overseeing large projects with a multitude of tasks, team members, clients, and end-users. This section outlines a sampling of these tools and techniques, although their implementation is dependent on the individual project, scope, and requirements that arise therein. Although these topics could be sprinkled throughout the preceding chapters, they are not concepts whose mastery is typically required of entry-level GIS analysts or technicians. Rather, they constitute a suite of skills and techniques that are often applied to a project after the basic GIS work has been completed. In this sense, this section is used as a platform on which to present novice GIS users with a sense of future pathways they may be led down, as well as providing hints to other potential areas of study that will complement their nascent GIS knowledge base.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <h3>Scheduling</h3>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">One of the most difficult and dread-inducing components of project management for many is the need to oversee a large and diverse group of team members. While this text does not cover tips for getting along with others, ensuring that each project member is on task and up to date is an excellent way to reduce potential problems associated with a complex project. To achieve this, there are several tools available to track project schedules and goal completions.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The Gantt chart (named after its creator, Henry Gantt) is a bar chart that is used specifically for tracking tasks throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, Gantt charts show the dependencies of interrelated tasks and focus on the start and completion dates for each specific task. Gantt charts will typically represent the estimated task completion time in one color and the actual time to completion in a second color (Figure 10.2 "Gantt Chart"). This color coding allows project members to rapidly assess the project progress and identify areas of concern in a timely fashion.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <div class="figure large medium-height editable block">
                  <p class="title">Figure 10.2</span> - Gantt Chart</p>
                <image src="gis-images/8ccfc61654c1f72a0e77e1b96ebc9077.jpg"></image>
                </div>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) charts are similar to Gantt charts in that they are both used to coordinate task completion for a given project (Figure 10.3 "PERT Chart"). PERT charts focus more on the events of a project than on the start and completion dates as seen with the Gantt charts. This methodology is more often used with very large projects where adherence to strict time guidelines is more important than monetary considerations. PERT charts include the identification of the project’s critical path. After estimating the best- and worst-case scenario regarding the time to finish all tasks, the critical path outlines the sequence of events that results in the longest potential duration for the project. Delays to any of the critical path tasks will result in a net delay to project completion and therefore must be closely monitored by the project manager.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <div class="figure large medium-height editable block">
                  <p class="title">Figure 10.3</span> - PERT Chart</p>
                <image src="gis-images/b904a5f308c2bf3fb5fd07f3a9760041.jpg"></image>
                </div>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">There are some advantages and disadvantages to both the Gantt and PERT chart types. Gantt charts are preferred when working with small, linear projects (with less than thirty or so tasks, each of which occurs sequentially). Larger projects (1) will not fit onto a single Gantt display, making them more difficult to visualize, and (2) quickly become too complex for the information therein to be related effectively. Gantt charts can also be problematic because they require a strong sense of the entire project’s timing before the first task has even been committed to the page. Also, Gantt charts don’t take correlations between separate tasks into account. Finally, any change to the scheduling of the tasks in a Gantt chart results in having to recreate the entire schedule, which can be a time-consuming and mind-numbing experience.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">PERT charts also suffer from some drawbacks. For example, the time to completion for each individual task is not as clear as it is with the Gantt chart. Also, large project can become very complex and span multiple pages. Because neither method is perfect, project managers will often use Gantt and PERT charts simultaneously to incorporate the benefits of each methodology into their project.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <h3>Working with CAD Data</h3>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">While a GIS commands a large swath of the computer-generated mapping market share, it is not the only cartographic player in town. GIS, as you now hopefully understand, is primarily a database-driven mapping solution. Computer-aided design (CAD), on the other hand, is a graphics-based mapping solution adopted by many cartographers; engineers in particular. Historically speaking, points, lines, and polygons in a CAD system do not link to attributes but are mere drawings representing some reality. CAD software, however, has recently begun to incorporate “smart” features whereby attribute information is explicitly linked to the spatial representations.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">CAD is typically used on many projects related to surveying and civil engineering work. For example, creating a <a class="glossterm">cadastral map</a> for a housing development is a complex matter with a fine scale of exactitude required to ensure, for example, that all electrical, sewer, transportation, and gas lines meet at precise locales (Figure 10.4 "CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project"). An error of inches, in either the vertical or horizontal dimension, could result in a need for a major plan redesign that may cost the client an inordinate amount of time and money. Too many of these types of errors, and you and your engineer may soon be looking for a new job.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <div class="figure large medium-height editable block">
                  <p class="title">Figure 10.4</span> - CAD Drawing of a Conceptual Land Development Project</p>
                <image src="gis-images/c73715695a8d08e5fd21c144fc0212bb.jpg"></image>
                </div>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Regardless, the CAD drawing used to create these development plans is usually only concerned with the local information in and around the project site that directly affects the construction of the housing units, such as local elevation, soil/substrates, land-use/land-cover types, surface water flows, and groundwater resources. Therefore, local coordinate systems are typically employed by the civil engineer whereby the origin coordinate (the 0, 0 point) is based off of some nearby landmark such as a manhole, fire hydrant, stake, or some other survey control point. While this is acceptable for engineers, the GIS user typically is concerned not only with local phenomena but also with tying the project into a larger world.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">For example, if a development project impacts a natural watercourse in the state of California, agencies such as the US Army Corps of Engineers (a nationwide government agency), California Department of Fish and Game (a statewide government agency), and the Regional Water Quality Control Board (a local government agency) will each exert some regulatory requirements over the developer. These agencies will want to know where the watercourse originates, where it flows to, where within the length of the watercourse the development project occurs, and what percentage of the watercourse will be impacted. These concerns can only be addressed by looking at the project in the larger context of the surrounding watershed(s) within which the project occurs. To accomplish this, external, standardized GIS datasets must be brought to bear on the project (e.g., national river reaches, stream flow and rain gauges, habitat maps, national soil surveys, and regional land-use/land-cover maps). These datasets will normally be georeferenced to some global standard and therefore will not automatically overlay with the engineer’s local CAD data.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">As project manager, it will be your team’s duty to import the CAD data (typically DWG, DGN, or DXF file format) and align it exactly with the other, georeferenced GIS data layers. While this has not been an easy task historically, sophisticated tools are being developed by both CAD and GIS software packages to ensure that they “play nicely” with each other. For example, ESRI’s ArcGIS software package contains a “Georeferencing” toolbar that allows users to shift, pan, resize, rotate, and add control points to assist in the realignment of CAD data.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <h3>Application Development</h3>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">As a project manager, you may find your team's GIS software lacking specific features that could significantly improve efficiency. Customizing existing software or even developing standalone GIS applications tailored to your project's needs could be a solution. These applications can range from simple (e.g., applying standardized symbology and labeling) to complex (e.g., advanced spatial analysis and automated map production).</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Many contemporary GIS platforms offer user-friendly tools to streamline application creation. For example, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview">ArcGIS Pro</a> includes ModelBuilder and its Python integration, allowing users without extensive coding knowledge to build complex workflows, saving time and effort.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The open-source movement has revolutionized GIS. Platforms like <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.osgeo.org/projects/mapguide-open-source/">MapGuide Open Source</a>, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> offer robust functionality and a vast developer community. Cloud-based GIS solutions are increasingly popular, facilitating collaboration, scalability, and reducing the need for in-house development.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Before starting from scratch, explore the wealth of pre-existing applications and libraries. Here's where things get interesting in 2024:</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;"><b>Open-Source Libraries:</b> GDAL/OGR, Proj4, GEOS, and Mapnik remain cornerstones, but there's a growing focus on libraries built for cloud-native workflows or supporting real-time data processing.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;"><b>Python's GIS Dominance:</b> Python has solidified its position as the premier language for GIS development, with extensive libraries for data manipulation, machine learning integrations, and web mapping (e.g., Folium, GeoPandas).</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;"><b>Web-Based GIS Applications:</b> JavaScript frameworks and libraries enable the creation of highly interactive web-based GIS applications, often leveraging services like Mapbox or Leaflet.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <h3>Map Series</h3>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">A project manager will often be required to produce paper and/or digital maps of the project site. These maps will typically include standard information such as a title, north arrow, scale bar, corporate contact information, data source, and so forth. This is simple if the site is small enough that the pertinent mapped features can be resolved on a single map. However, problems arise if the site is exceedingly large, follows a linear pathway (e.g., highway improvement projects), or is composed of distant, noncontiguous site locales. In these cases, the manager will need to create a series of easily referenced and reproduced maps that are at the exact same scale, have minimal overlap, and maintain consistent collar material throughout.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">To accomplish this task, a map series can be employed to create standardized maps from the GIS. A map series is essentially a multipage document created by dividing the overall data frame into unique tiles based on a user-defined index grid. Figure 10.5 "Project Site Tiled into an Output Series" shows an example of a map series that divides a project site into a grid of similar tiles. Figure 10.6 "Output from a Map Series" shows the standardized maps produced when that series is printed. While these maps can certainly be created without the use of a map series generator, this functionality greatly assists in the organization and display of project’s whose extents cannot be represented within a single map.</span></p>

                <h3>Grid-to-Ground Transformations</h3>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Project managers must be mindful of the transition from in-program mapped units to real-world locations. As discussed in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../GIS/data-information-and-where-to-.html">Chapter 3 "Data, Information, and Where to Find Them"</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../GIS/data-about-data.html">Section 3.2 "Data about Data"</a>, transforming the three-dimensional earth to two dimensions necessarily results in both accuracy and precision errors. While projects that cover a small areal extent may not noticeably suffer from this error, projects that cover a large areal extent could run into substantial problems.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">When surveyors measure the angles and distances of features on the earth for input into a GIS, they are taking “ground” measurements. However, spatial datasets in a GIS are based on a predefined coordinate system, referred to as “grid” measurements. In the case of angles, ground measurements are taken relative to some north standard such as true north, grid north, or magnetic north. Grid measurements are always relative to the coordinate system’s grid north. Therefore, grid north and ground north may well need to be rotated in order to align correctly.</span></p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">In the case of distances, two sources of error may be present: (1) scale error and (2) elevation error. Scale error refers to the phenomenon whereby points measured on the three-dimensional earth (i.e., ground measurement) must first be translated onto the coordinate system’s ellipsoid (i.e., mean sea level), and then must be translated to the two-dimensional grid plane (Figure 10.7 "Grid-to-Ground Transformation"). Basically, scale error is associated with the move from three to two dimensions and is remedied by applying a scale factor (SF) to any measurements made to the dataset.</span></p>

                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">In addition to scale error, elevation error becomes increasingly pronounced as the project site’s elevation begins to rise. Consider Figure 10.8 "Grid versus Ground Measurements", where a line measured as 1,000 feet at altitude must first be scaled down to fit the earth’s ellipsoid measurement, then scaled again to fit the coordinate system’s grid plane. Each such transition requires compensation, referred to as the elevation factor (EF). The SF and EF are often combined into a single combination factor (CF) that is automatically applied to any measurements taken from the GIS.</span></p>

                &nbsp;
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">In addition to EF and SF errors, care must be taken when surveying areas greater than 5 miles in length. At these distances, slight errors will begin to compound and may create noticeable discrepancies. In particular, projects whose length crosses over coordinate systems zones (e.g., Universal Transverse Mercator [UTM] zones or State Plane zones) are likely to suffer from unacceptable grid-to-ground errors.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">While the tools and techniques outlined in this section may be considered beyond the scope of an introductory text on GISs, these pages represent some of the concerns that will arise during your tenure as a GIS project manager. Although you will not need a comprehensive understanding of these issues for your first GIS-related jobs, it is important that you understand that becoming a competent GIS user will require a wide-ranging skill set, both technically and interpersonally.</span></p>

                  <li>Consider the following GIS project: You are contacted by the City of Miami to determine the effect of inundation due to sea-level rise on municipal properties over the next hundred years. Assuming that the sea level will rise one meter during that time span, describe in detail the process you would take to respond to this inquiry. Assuming you have two months to complete this task, develop a timeline that shows the steps you would take to respond to the city’s request. In your discussion, include information pertaining to the data layers (both raster and vector), data sources, and data attributes needed to address the problem. Outline some of the geoprocessing steps that would be required to convert your baseline GIS data into project-specific layers that would address this particular problem. Upon completion of the geospatial analysis, how might you employ cartographic principals to most effectively present the data to city officials? Talk about potential problems that may arise during the analysis and discuss how you might go about addressing these issues.</li>
